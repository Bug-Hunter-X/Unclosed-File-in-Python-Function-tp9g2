This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: forgetting to close a file after opening it. This can lead to resource exhaustion if many files are opened without being closed. The example provided shows how a function opens a file but fails to close it, leading to a potential bug. The solution showcases best practices, using context managers, to ensure that files are automatically closed, even if exceptions are raised.
